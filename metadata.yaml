# Availability is either critical (=true) or non-critical (=false). Critical
# means: If the data provided by this service is *lost* (or not available for
# longer than a day) then a core business process is negatively affected. For
# example: If single-sign-on authentication is down, then login is partially
# impossible and multiple business processes are affected. The value is made
# available by the HoT (or HoP) and specified in the Information Security
# Objectives Policy:
# https://gs24.sharepoint.com/risk_compliance_en/Policies/Policy%20Information%20Security%20Objectives.pdf.
#
#   Type:    boolean
#
# availability: true
#
availability: false

# Confidentiality classifies the sensitivity of the data this service contains,
# works with or works on. This roughly translates to how big the impact is when
# the data is *breached*. The value is made available by the HoT (or HoP) and
# specified in the Information Security Objectives Policy:

# Integrity is either critical (=true) or non-critical (=false). Critical means:
# If the data provided by this service is *wrong* (or not correct for longer than

# multiple core business processes. The value is made available by the HoT (or
